# 💥 HULK PLUGIN FOR PWNAGOTCHI - TOPCEEKRETTS EDITION 💥

**VERSION 3.0.0 – FORGED IN FLAMES, TESTED IN CHAOS**  
Risen from code and caffeine, resurrected by the dark hands of **TOPCEEKRETTS**, powered by packets and profanity.

---

## 🔥 WHAT IS THIS BEAST?

Welcome to **HULK** mode – your Pwnagotchi ain't cute anymore.  
It’s angry. It’s vulgar. It’s jacked on scapy and hellfire.

- 💣 **DEAUTH**: Blanket-disconnect every network like a goddamn blackout.
- 🔊 **BEACON FLOOD**: Flood the air with psychotic SSIDs.
- 👻 **PROBE SPAM**: Probe like your ex lookin' through your phone.
- 😈 **INSULTS**: Your gotchi spits verbal napalm.

## 🧠 INSTALLATION – GET IT IN

### 📁 STEP 1: DROP THE PAIN
Copy the plugin file into your Pwnagotchi plugin dir:

```bash
cp hulk_upgraded.py ~/.config/pwnagotchi/plugins/
```

### ⚙️ STEP 2: UNLEASH THE ANGER
Edit your `~/.config/pwnagotchi/config.toml` like so:

```toml
main.plugins.hulk.enabled = true
main.plugins.hulk.rage_level = 4
main.plugins.hulk.beacon_flood = true
main.plugins.hulk.probe_spam = true
```

### 🔄 STEP 3: REBOOT THE HULK
```bash
sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi
```

---

## 🧨 WHAT TO EXPECT

Your logs become a war journal.  
Your OLED becomes a window into madness.  
Your gotchi becomes a little green god of cyber destruction.

## 🧼 TO ESCAPE (IF YOU MUST)

Disable it in the config and restart. But... why would you?  
That’s like taming a dragon then asking it to play fetch.

---

## 🧬 LICENSE

**GPLv3** – It’s free. It’s filthy. It’s forever.  
Fork it. Abuse it. Just don’t neuter it.
