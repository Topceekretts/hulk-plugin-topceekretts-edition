# 💥 HULK PLUGIN FOR PWNAGOTCHI - TOPCEEKRETTS EDITION 💥

**VERSION 3.0.0 – AIN’T NO BETA HERE, BABY. THIS ONE *SLAPS***  
Smash your enemies, piss on their firewalls, and crap all over weak-ass Wi-Fi security. This ain’t your grandma’s plugin. This is Hulk, reloaded by the diabolical mastermind known as **TOPCEEKRETTS** (with the help of a friendly AI demon).  

## 🔥 WHAT IS IT?

This here beast of a plugin turns your Pwnagotchi into a **rage-fueled, packet-bleeding machine**.  
- DEAUTH everything.  
- BEACON flood with names like ‘ANGRY_GREEN_DICK_SIGNAL’.  
- PROBE until the routers cry.  
- Hulk quotes so nasty they make your logs NSFW.

## 💀 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

### 📦 Step 1: SLAP IT IN
Put `hulk_upgraded.py` into your `~/.config/pwnagotchi/plugins/` directory:

```bash
cp hulk_upgraded.py ~/.config/pwnagotchi/plugins/
```

### ⚙️ Step 2: OPEN THE GATES
Edit your `~/.config/pwnagotchi/config.toml`:

```toml
main.plugins.hulk.enabled = true
main.plugins.hulk.rage_level = 3 # 1-5 recommended. 5 is pure chaos.
main.plugins.hulk.beacon_flood = true
main.plugins.hulk.probe_spam = true
```

### 🧠 Step 3: REBOOT THAT MF

sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi
```

Expect chaos. Expect beauty. Expect glory.
